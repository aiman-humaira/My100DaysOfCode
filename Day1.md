Today I read the first chapter in Kitab Full Stack.
I learnt about the OSI layers, protocols and error messages.

Then, I watched a YouTube video by FreeCodeCamp on Android development.
I installed Android Studio and a bunch of APIs and SDKs.
I am looking forward to create applications on the upcoming days!

Later during the night I did some Basic HTML & HTML5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
I learnt how to make headers, paragraphs, links, text fields, buttons, radio buttons, bullet list and numbered list.
I am only 86% finished though, so I will continue finishing them tomorrow.

I am feeling great so far! Though I do hesitate whether I am doing the right thing or no
BUT I kept in mind that any action is always better than doing nothing at all.
Hopefully I'll get the hang of it soon! :)
