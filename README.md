# My 100 Days of Code
Taking this challenge to improve my coding and programming knowledge and skills! May Allah ease :)

Currently, I only have a tad bit of knowledge of Java, and nothing else.
I'm interested in learning python, UI/UX design and app development, though I know nothing about them.
Hopefully by taking this challenge I'll be able to explore them and somehow figure out what is it that I really want to expertise in.
Let's go!
